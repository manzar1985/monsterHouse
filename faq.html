However, they may not include all the information your local building department wants in order to issue you a permit. For example, the house plans will not include a site plan, septic design, well permit, or engineering specific to your region’s weather, wind, soil or seismic conditions. Your building department will provide you with a checklist of all requirements for a building permit. For more info, see Building Codes & Permits.
